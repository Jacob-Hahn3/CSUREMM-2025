Demographic Predictors of Flu Vaccination Uptake Research Project

The COVID‚Äê19 pandemic contributed to devastating effects on the healthcare system and led to increased vaccine hesitancy and fatigue. At the same time, vaccination efforts become more politicized, influencing how people view public health recommendations [1]. These changes may have affected seasonal flu vaccination, with uptake patterns shifting over time and across different populations. Our project explores how sociodemographic factors relate to these trends. 

This project aims to identify the most influential demographic factors in determining influenza vaccination uptake before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.} Existing literature identified critical sociodemographic factors in predicting COVID-19 vaccine uptake [2]. We build on this research by extending the analysis to the flu, by incorporating healthcare and political data, and by following flu vaccine uptake across time.
